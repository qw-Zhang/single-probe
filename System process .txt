Input: Standard signal of length L which is generated by BSE, the parameters which build the channel PDP
Output: Combined fading signal S_R
	1	Generate PDP by the input parameters througn Channel Emulator
	2	Convolved the standard signals with the corresponding sub-PDPs to generate S_1, S_2,...,S_K,
		K is the number of probe ositions allocated by Channel Emulator
	3	Set i = 1
	4	While i<= k do
	5		Move the probe to each probe position
	6		Probe transmit S_i signal
	7		Time Synsensizer(TS) get and temporally store S_1, S_2â€¦S_k,
	8		TS generate Chirp signal with known parameters
	9		P_i = correlation S_i with Chirp	//P_i represents the started position of frame in S_i
	10		TS generate P_est_i of S_i after timing estimation	
	11		S_R = S_R + S_i[P_est_i]:S_i[P_est_i + L]
	12		i = i + 1
	13	Stop
